        <h1>Section 2: Migration Occurs at Multiple Spatial Scales</h1>
        <img src="img/sec4.jpg" style="width: 80%; height: auto;">
        <h2>1. Scales of migration</h2>
        <p>- Local (e.g. moving within a city – no change of job or socialnetworks required)</p>
        <p>- Regional (e.g. crossing county lines within a state – sufficient distance to break 
            networks, change job location)</p>
        <p>- National (e.g. state-to-state migration)</p>
        <p>- International (e.g. from one country to another)</p>
        <p>- Most moves are short distance: local, regional</p>
        <h2>2. International immigrant to the US</h2>
        <p>- are “aliens” admitted to the United States for lawful permanent residence.</p>
        <p>- they may be issued immigrant visas overseas by the Department of State or 
            adjusted to permanent resident status in the United States by US Bureau of CIS.</p>
        <h2>3. Defind of immigration</h2>
        <p>- defined as the number of immigrants arriving during a
            specified period of time, such as a year or a decade</p>
        <p>- going beyond official definitions: anybody in the US for > a certain period of time 
            e.g. a temp worker on an H1-B could be in the country for 10 years before adjusting status to lawful permanent residence</p>
